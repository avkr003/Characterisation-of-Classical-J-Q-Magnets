For temperature = 0, execute Semester 7 and 8, written in MATLAB. Sem 7 has only classical Heisenberg model but sem 8 includes extra term in the Hamiltonian on the top of work during sem 7. It was aimed to see effects of quantum criticality in classical regime (near temperature close to 0)

For temperature > 0, execute files in Summer folder, written in Python.
